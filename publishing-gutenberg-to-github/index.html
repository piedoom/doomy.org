<p>As of now, Zola (previously known as Gutenberg) has much easier ways of doing this! Please consider Github actions, or Netlify.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="gutenberg-static-site-generators">Gutenberg &amp; Static Site generators</h1>
<p>If you're familiar with Github, you're most likely also aware of the Github Pages tool that allows users to publish static sites.  This is particularly useful for docs or a blog.  By default, Github uses Jekyll (A ruby based static site generator), but you can use whatever you want provided you have an <code>index.html</code> file in the root of a branch called <code>gh-pages</code>.</p>
<p>I recently came across a project called <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.getgutenberg.io/">Gutenberg</a> by <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg">Keats</a> and other contributors.  I was initially interested in the project because I like the Rust programming language, but Gutenberg has the additional value of having everything-you-need in a single executable.</p>
<p>This means that you don't need to fiddle with RVM or Python on your local machine to get started - you just need a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.getgutenberg.io/documentation/getting-started/installation/">single executable</a>.  Being said, Gutenberg is opinionated, so don't expect a billion preprocessors bundled.  You get Tera - a fine templating markup - as well as an SCSS preprocessor.  If for some reason you love to torture yourself with CoffeeScript or Babel, you'll have to do that stuff on your own.</p>
<h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h1>
<p>This post is not about how to use Gutenberg.  For that stuff, please check out Gutenberg's official docs.  They're super easy to read through and quick to execute.  <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.getgutenberg.io/">See it here.</a></p>
<h1 id="automating">Automating</h1>
<p>Unlike Jekyll, Gutenberg is not run by Github.  In other words, if you push Gutenberg project files, they won't automatically build inside of Github and publish to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.  However, we can use Travis CI to do this for us.</p>
<p>I'm not going to explain exactly how to set up Travis as there are great documents already on that subject.  All you need to do is set up a new Github repository and enable it within the Travis dashboard.</p>
<h2 id="adding-to-your-gitignore">Adding to your <code>.gitignore</code></h2>
<p>You don't want your project pushing the generated site to master accidentally if you do something like <code>gutenberg build</code> on master.  I recommend adding the following files to your <code>.gitignore</code>.  Keep in mind that this assumes that your project files are in the root directory.  For a static site generator <em>within</em> a code project, the structure may be different.</p>
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">public
</span></code></pre>
<p>And that's it.  Gutenberg outputs everything to the <code>public</code> directory (unless of course you use the new <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/pull/191"><code>--ouput-dir parameter</code></a>)</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-travis">Setting up Travis</h2>
<p>Before pushing anything, Travis needs a Github private access key in order to make changes to your repository.  If you're already logged in to your account, just click <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">here</a> to go to your tokens page.  Otherwise, navigate to <code>Settings &gt; Developer Settings &gt; Personal Access Tokens</code>.  Generate a new token, and give it any description you'd like.  Under the "Select Scopes" section, give it <code>repo</code> permissions.  Click "Generate token" to finish up.</p>
<p>Your token will now be visible!  Copy it into your clipboard and head back to Travis.  Once on Travis, click on your project, and navigate to "Settings".  Scroll down to "Environment Variables" and input a name of <code>GH_TOKEN</code> with a value of your access token.  Make sure "Display value in build log" is off, and then click add.  Now Travis has access to your repository.</p>
<h3 id="encrypted-keys">Encrypted Keys</h3>
<p>Alternatively, you can put encrypted keys right into your <code>.travis.yml</code> file by using <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-encrypted-variables-in-.travis.yml">this</a> method.  Although this can be seen as more legible for other users, it requires Ruby and a special Travis gem.  I didn't have Ruby on my system, and I didn't feel like installing RVM, so I opted for just using the website.  Either is fine, and either will work!  If you do already have Ruby installed, I recommend the encrypted keys method.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-your-settings">Setting up your settings</h2>
<p>We're almost done.  We just need some scripts in a <code>.travis.yml</code> file to tell Travis what to do.</p>

<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">You&#39;ll need to write your domain name with the `-c` flag.  For instance, my website looks like this:

</span><span class="z-text z-plain">If all goes well, the next time you make a push on `master`, your Github Pages should update and be visible.  If it&#39;s not working, wait a minute or so.  Also make sure that the settings on your Github repo allow Github Pages.
