It's been a while! I haven't been not-busy, but writing is effort, u kno?

Well to make up for that, I'm going to be documenting progress using & learning the Amethyst game engine.

## Amethyst
So, what is Amethyst? [It's a game engine](https://amethyst.rs/) written with the Rust programming language. I've been involved as a volunteer since winter, and I've been learning the engine itself more and more each day.

Hopefully by documenting my progress here, I can document early issues I ran into, and how to solve them.

## Game
To be honest, I don't really have that perfectly nailed down right now. My goal is to just make *something* that I can build off of. At first, I tried a simple DDR/FFR style rhythm game.
