Woah, I released something!

DoomyScreen is a simple screen sharing application that allows uploading to Imgur and copying to the clipboard.  I developed it after puu.sh got horribly slow.

#### Features:

- Configurable Hotkeys
- Runs in task tray when not being used
- Auto-updates so more good stuff to come
- Uploads to Imgur and copies the link, or copies to the clipboard
- Multiple monitor support
- Free!

You can download the application [here](/files/doomyscreen/Setup.exe).  It's an auto-updating installable that requires no administrative privileges.  Alternatively, you can do a system-wide install with the [msi installer here](/files/doomyscreen/Setup.msi).
