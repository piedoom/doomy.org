# vaporsoft
This is a website where I write about a variety of programming and computer-related topics.

# building & usage
I use [Zola](https://getzola.org) as a static site generator, and use GitHub actions to push 
new builds from the `gh-pages` branch.

## Taxonomies
`tags` are the only supported taxonomy at the moment.

# themes
I use my [feather](https://github.com/piedoom/feather) theme for Zola.
