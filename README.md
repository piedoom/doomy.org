# vaporsoft
This is a website where I write about a variety of programming and computer-related topics.

# building & usage
I use [Gutenberg](https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg) as a static site generator, and use Travis to push 
new builds to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Taxonomies
Only `categories` are taxonomies at the moment. Tags seem like they should be, but they are instead under `extra`, since they are used primarily for SEO purposes.

# themes
I use my [feather](https://github.com/piedoom/feather) theme for Gutenberg.

# contributing
If you find a mistake, have a question, or a suggestion, please open up an issue or submit a PR.  Please format them similarly to examples below
for sake of clarity so that I can understand what article or problem you are talking about.  Don't worry about getting this super right
and don't feel intimidated to suggest something.  If it's 3AM, you're drunk, and submit a fix like "jjg dpost no good hrers the link"
I'll still be happy that you submitted something to help me out.

site issue example:
```
Title: Text is not justified on mobile
Description: [Description of issue] on Firefox 8 Windows 10
```

Unfortunately, articles don't really have any ID besides their URL slug.  However, I don't usually post more than one article per day, so 
writing the date in the title is a succicnt way to narrow down what you're talking about.  In the description, provide the full title
of the post along with your mistake fix.  You can omit the mistake fix in the description if you're submitting a PR.

article mistake example:
```
Title: spelling error on Jan 3 2018
Description: "Creating a simple synthesizer VST plugin in Rust" has a mistake here [text to fix and replacement]
```

The same format is useful for suggestions.

Suggestion format:
```
Title: Add an explanation for DSP on Jan 3 2018
Description: "Creating a simple synthesizer VST plugin in Rust" should make sure the user knows that ...(etc.)...
```

# things to avoid
Any opinions shared on the website are my own, and you are free to disagree.  However, please use the commenting system on the website
to raise arguments as opposed to submitting a Github issue.  Remember to always be respectful - vaporsoft is a leftist space.

# credit
If an issue or PR of yours is accepted, you will be credited in the article.  I will use the name provided on your GH and link to your
profile.  

## gender & pronouns
As a catch all, I use "they" to refer to contributors as it can describe all genders.  If you have issue with this and would like
me to use something else for your contribution, please let me know.  You can do so privately if you wish by sending me an email at 
alexanderpaullozada @ google's popular email service.
